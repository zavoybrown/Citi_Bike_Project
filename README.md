This tableau dashboard visualizes an analysis of public bike stations in New York City.

The visualizations include most popular and least popular start and end stations for all rides in the time frame.

It also includes an analysis of membership vs. casual customer segmentations, a time analysis of most popular ride times throughout the day, as well as a geospatial map of most dense riding areas in the city.
